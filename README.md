# AutoLib-Hypothesis
#### AutoLib Dataset Analysis, 17/05/2020
#### By **M A P**
## Description
In this project I sought to understand the electric car usage by solving for another research question. 
As a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset. 
The selected periods of interest be either weekdays or weekends but not a mix of both. 
I also considered postal codes as some of the areas of interest.
My claim is that the number of Bluecars taken from postal code 75015 is the same as in postal code 75017 during weekdays

**Research Question**

The research problem is to investigate the electric (bluecars) car usage in Paris during weekdays.. 
Your solution will measure my metric of success which will be achieved based on the analysis if the null hypothesis is true.

*   Define the question, the metric for success, the context, experimental design taken and the appropriateness of the available data to answer the given question
*   Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.


*   Perform univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis recording your observations.
*   Implement the solution by performing the respective hypothesis test.
